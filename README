Python script to love spotify's current playing track on Last.fm. 
It also show's notification with current artist,track name and users playcount after success.

Requirements

1) Uses pytify to get current playing track metadata.
2) Uses python gntp to add support for growl notifications.


Exception Handling is STILL missing.


You can add AutoHotkey Keyboard shortcut to execute your script at once.
I added Ctrl+q as my shortcut https://github.com/ranveer5289/Miscellaneous-Programs/blob/master/AutoHotkey/spotify_love.ahk
