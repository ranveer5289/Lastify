Python script to love spotify's current playing track on Last.fm. 
It also show's notification with current artist,track name and users playcount after success.

Requirements

1) Uses pytify to get current playing track metadata.
2) Uses pywin32
3) Uses python gntp to add support for growl notifications.
4) Uses pylast to interact with last.fm


Exception Handling is STILL missing.
